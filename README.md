# gulp-templates
###### Useful working templates with gulp
===

`/gulp-tasks-lib` stores all the possible gulp task.

You can put the gulp-task that you'd like to use in `/gulp-tasks-use`. In `gulpfile.js`, those tasks would be included via `gulp-task-loader` plugin.

When using, remember to modify `.gitignore` for your own purposes.\
e.g. comment out `app/**/*` and `build/**` to track files
